        <h5> Designed to solve Stratford's transportation issues </h5>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4 class="container2">The Project</h4>
    <div class="dotted container3">
      <p>Finding a way to commute to Stratford becomes the responsibility and added stress for upper-year students in
        the GBDA program. As the UX designer, I created a rideshare app exclusive to GBDA and MDEI students using the
        <span class="bold"> HCD design process.​</span>
      </p>
      <p> <span class="bold">Duration:</span> 3 months</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Methods:</span>Primary Research, Interviews, Surveys, User Persona, Experience Map, User
        Flow Chart, Wireframes, Mockups, Prototypes, First-click testing, Contextual Interview</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Tools:</span>Balsamiq, Adobe XD, Figma, InVision</p>
    </div>


    <h4 class="container2">About Stratford's Transportation</h4>
    <div class="container3">
      <p>It is difficult to find a place to live in Stratford as the off-campus housing link provided on the
        university's official site is very limited. Students are taking action by having a rideshare Facebook page along
        with various cohort group chats to make carpooling more accessible for all students. However, with the gas price
        increase, it is becoming costly for the passengers to support this system along with other expenses. This has
        led many GBDA and MDEI students to choose to live on the Waterloo campus, but the inconvenience of
        transportation increases the financial burden on students. </p>
    </div>



    <h4 class="container2">Process</h4>
    <p class="container3">WatRides followed an HCD process by first conducting user research. After synthesizing surveys
      and interviews,
      the problem was identified, and the project moved forward to the ideation phase where potential ideas/
      functionalities were brainstormed. Then, the process between high-fidelity prototypes and usability testing was
      iterated based on students' feedback.</p>

    <div class="container3 image-container">
      <img src="./assets/case/watrides/2.webp" class="container3">
    </div>


    <h4 class="container2">Research</h4>
    <p class="container3 hgray">SkateYou</p>

    <p class="container3">According to a survey conducted in the GBDA student group chat, the majority voted for
      commuting to the Stratford campus by carpool instead of driving. The results also suggested most GBDA students
      live at Waterloo instead of Stratford. Many factors such as accessibility to entertainment, leisure, retail, and
      housing influence students’ decision to opt for the carpool option. In other words, there is more available and
      affordable off-campus housing in Waterloo whereas there are limited housing options in Stratford. Many students
      living at Stratford share the same house with their landlords while the off-campus housing in Waterloo provides an
      entire unit exclusively to students. Additionally, there are many four-month or eight-month sublet groups on
      Facebook that provide flexibility to students who are looking for short-term housing.</p>


    <div class="container3 grid">
      <img class="modal-image" src="./assets/case/watrides/3.webp" alt="">
      <p>It is important to note that many students prefer to live in Waterloo and commute to Stratford because of the
        larger community and student population. This allows them to stay connected to their peers and friends, instead
        of feeling isolated.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="container3">Housing options in Stratford are considerably limited compared to Waterloo. From housing
      agencies such as KW4RENT, ACCOMMD8U, and private landlords, and WUSA’s latest legal service department to protect
      students, living at Waterloo campus is not only convenient but also safe. Another factor that should be mentioned
      is first years usually live on campus, but Stratford doesn’t provide on campus-housing.</p>



    <div class="container3 image-container">
      <img class="modal-image" src="./assets/case/watrides/4.webp" class="container3">
    </div>


    <p class="container3">Moreover, people said that they would rather spend money on transportation for the sake of
      their social life and living quality in Waterloo. The only participant who was interested in moving to Stratford
      noted that housing was more affordable over there compared to Waterloo.</p>

    <p class="container4 gray italic">"Mainly the expensive housing and lack of part-time job opportunities, I need to
      make enough money to pay for my rent + food + monthly bills + necessities, that isn't really feasible in
      Stratford"</p>

    <h4 class="container2">The Problem Statement</h4>
    <p class="container3">Based on research, <span class="bold">the lack of accessibility to rideshare </span>for
      students from Waterloo to Stratford and <span class="bold">the lack of social/community engagement </span>in
      Stratford are the two major factors that pushed students away from living at Stratford. Currently, there is no
      existing platform that provides <span class="bold">secured</span>rideshares and events information to GBDA and
      MDEI students. Therefore, the problem statement focuses on: </p>

    <div class="p1 finding container3 border">
      <p class="bold italic">
        How might we create a carpool platform for GBDA and MDEI students that provides safe transportation and helps
        connect the Waterloo and Stratford community?​
      </p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="container2">Ideation</h4>
    <p class="container3">In this phase, potential features and solutions were drawn on the whiteboard using the <span
        class="bold">sketchstorming</span> method. This step brought ideas to life and helped removed
      redundant/unfeasible features.</p>

    <p class="container3 hgray">Primary Features Of Watrides</p>
    <p class="container3">Post rides, book rides, and events were the primary features that were emphasized during the
      sketch phase. These functions were designed with the problem statement in mind. Post & Book Rides under user
      authentication guarantees secure transportation whereas the Events section for both Waterloo and Stratford events
      was designed to help increase the community engagement aspect.</p>

      <h5>Secure UW student Login </h5>
      <p>Users were fond of the idea of having an exclusive ride share app for Global Business and Digital Arts (GBDA)
        students. By logging in from the university's system, the app can verify one's identity and prevent strangers
        from joining. </p>
      <p class="gray italic border-left px1">" Finally we can stop posting on Facebook asking for strangers to take us
        to the Stratford campus. I always have to cross my fingers that my driver isn't going to be a creepy
        stranger..."</p>
      <p class="gray italic border-left px1">" Wow, I feel special for being in GBDA rn! I mean having our own rideshare
        app? SIGN ME UP!!!"</p>

    <div class="p1 finding container3 shadow">
      <p class="gray small">User Feedback #2</p>
      <h5>Connecting with the Stratford / Waterloo community </h5>
      <p>Due to the distance between the main campus and Stratford campus, GBDA students from both communities are
        disconnected from one another. Most importantly, events hosted by the opposite campus are often overlooked
        because of the lack of a shared platform - Stratford students miss out on Waterloo events and vice versa. </p>
      <p>Hence, the Events page features a wide range of Waterloo & Stratford events, aiming to rebuild the gap between
        the two communities. A list of rides will then be displayed to students who confirm their event attendance.</p>
      <p class="gray italic border-left px1">" lol I always find out about Stratford events until the day after. Nice
        idea."</p>

      <p class="gray small">User Feedback #4</p>
      <h5>Beyond a driver & passenger relationship / Avoid conflict </h5>
      <p>Because this rideshare app is exclusive to GBDA students, the app may help the driver and passenger form
        meaningful connections/friendships as opposed to a one-time interaction. On the other hand, users can avoid
        awkward encounters with peers that they have conflicts with by checking the driver's profile and passenger's
        list.</p>

      <p class="gray italic border-left px1">" This is something I need. PERIOD."</p>

    <h4 class="container2">Reflection & Prototype</h4>
    <p class="container3">Overall, the rideshare ecosystem consists of housing, transportation, financial cost, and a
      sense of community. It is important to bring light to this issue in order to build a better future for students at
      the Stratford School. </p>

    <p class="hgray container3">Early-stage product = more potential but heavier workload</p>

    <p class="container3">It was my first time working on a personal project. Although I was able to have more space and
      flexibility to explore design options and user interactions, I also needed to create mockups for every single
      screen and justify my rationale to different audiences. It was a lot of work, but I was able to practice working
      independently and create deadlines for myself to stay on track. Moreover, I learned how to conduct moderated
      interviews and think-aloud usability testing, which helped me gain valuable insights into the redesign process.
