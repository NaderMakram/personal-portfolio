    <div class="dotted container3">
      <p>S.K.A.T.E. is a social media mobile application that I created as a part of my User Experience
        Design course at the University of Waterloo. As the UX designer, I designed the project from inception to final
        design through <span class="bold"> research, ideation, and UX design principles.</span></p>
      <p> <span class="bold">Duration:</span> 3 months</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Methods:</span>Secondary Research, Competitive Analysis, User Persona, Interviews, Surveys,

      <p>Skateboarders around the world have spent years honing their skills and building an international community.
        However, every skateboarder is limited in their own way, whether it be physical, financial, or environmental.

        </span>share, and teach each other new skills anytime and anywhere.</p>

    <h4 class="container2">Findings</h4>

    <div class="p1 finding container3 shadow">
      <p class="gray small">Finding #1</p>
      <h5>Sharing the same goal</h5>
      <p>There are many apps for skateboards, but most of them are created for skaters who want to find a good place to
        skate or connect with other skateboards</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p1 finding container3 shadow">
      <p class="gray small">Finding #2</p>
      <h5>Strong sense of community</h5>
      <p>The community page is a prominent feature in every skate app. One of the similarities shared across all the
        skateboarding apps is the community aspect. Skate apps that establish a well-built community receives higher
        ratings as well. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p1 finding container3 shadow">
      <p class="gray small">Finding #3</p>
      <h5>Male-targeted user interface designs</h5>
      <p>There are very few colors and the content organization is narrow, condensed, and orderly in most of the
        existing skateboarding apps.</p>

    <h4 class="container2">Interviews & Surveys</h4>
    <p class="container3">With the help of several skate park owners, interviews were conducted with skateboarding
      amateurs and experts from the age of 10 to 40s.</p>
    <p class="hgray container3">Goal</p>
    <p class="container4">With the help of several skate park owners, interviews were conducted with skateboarding
      amateurs and experts from the age of 10 to 40s.</p>

    <p class="container3 bold">Out of the 8 participants, about 21% are in the age group of 10 to 15, 78% in the age
      group of 16 to 25, and 1% in the 30+ age group.</p>

    <h4 class="container2">Insights from interviews and surveys</h4>

    <div class="p1 finding container3 border">
      <p class="gray small">Insight #1</p>
      <h5>Skate culture = Counter culture</h5>
      <p>Many participants noted that skating is about self-expression, risk-taking, and freedom. They emphasized it as
        a way to express every facet of oneself, including political ideals and ethical/moral values. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p1 finding container3 border">
      <p class="gray small">Insight #2</p>
      <h5>The importance of location </h5>
      <p>Locations and environments are crucial parts of a skateboarder's identity and culture. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p1 finding container3 border">
      <p class="gray small">Insight #3</p>
      <h5>Community, community, and community </h5>
      <p>The community aspect of skateboarding culture was heavily emphasized and discussed by participants during the
        interviews. </p>
      <p class="gray italic border-left px1">"If you talk to local skateboarders, you will see people dedicated to
        building bonds within their coterie, mentoring youth, and engaging the larger local community.."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p1 finding container3 border">
      <p class="gray small">Insight #4</p>
      <h5>Supporting local skate shops </h5>
      <p>People should start purchasing their skateboarding equipment at local stores instead of online. Having a skate
        shop locally helps to keep people interested in skating which spawns new skaters. It can also help with getting
        local skate parks built. </p>
      <p class="gray italic border-left px1">"My advice is to try to support the local shop. They're a big part of our
        culture. Without them, we'll be losing a huge part of what skateboarding is. A skate shop is a place for local
        skaters to meet. It is not just a place to buy things. It is in a way a community center for the local
        skateboarding scene."</p>

    <p class="container3 hgray">Usability Test</p>
    <p class="container4">To ensure that the app was built appropriately and was accessible for skaters, the usability
      test included the
      app's stakeholders and skateboarder experts. Several vulnerabilities were identified in the structure of the user
      interface.</p>


    <h4 class="container2">Adjustments</h4>
    <div class="p1 finding container3 shadow">
      <p class="gray small">Adjustment #1</p>
      <h5>Navigation bar</h5>
      <p>An indicator should be included to show users which page they are on.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p1 finding container3 shadow">
      <p class="gray small">Adjustment #2</p>
      <h5>Asynchronous games</h5>
      <p>The live game aspect of the app was originally inspired by Pokemon GO, wherein the user can see all the local
        skateparks on an overlay map. They would be able to play games of SKATE with their friends <span
          class="bold">live</span> and challenge “kings of the park” (users who have won the most SKATE points at a
        certain location). However, those who don’t have the luxury of a data plan are not accommodated. To solve this
        issue, users can post skate tricks and ask to be challenged on a feed, and other users who see it will be able
        to accept/decline the challenge. These games would take place asynchronously and may last for a couple of days.
        This way, people with different time zones may also play with each other!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p1 finding container3 shadow">
      <p class="gray small">Adjustment #3</p>
      <h5>Local shop page</h5>
      <p>Connecting users with local skate shops should be the priority instead of product sales. Consider providing
        coupons or gift cards that would encourage users to visit and support local skate shops instead.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="container2">Outcome & Prototype</h4>
    <p class="container3">From understanding the Canadian skate culture to researching different online skateboarding
      apps and how skateboarders communicate online, I have begun to understand what skate culture is, and thus, what
      kind of product fits the skater's values.</p>

    <p class="container3 hgray">If there was more time available...​</p>
    <ul class="container4">
      <li>

        Forging partnerships among local skate shops, initiatives, and groups for a more in-depth usability testing
      </li>
      <li>

        Distributing collectible items (like a sticker or pins) done by local artists at each skate shop location in
